\section*{Abstract}
The development of an explosive cyclone over the southeastern region of Buenos
Aires Province on April 28, 2020, affected the city of Mar del Plata, producing
intense rainfall, flooding, evacuations, and causing damage across the area.
Mar del Plata is one of the most populated coastal cities in Argentina, with
high touristic and economic importance for the province.

This study focuses on heat fluxes as the main ingredient in the formation of the
explosive cyclogenesis, and highlights the importance of identifying such
systems, since even though they usually reach their maximum deepening once they
move over the ocean, they can still significantly affect the continental area.
